        Address level data concerning the energy performance of buildings constitute personal data for the purposes
        of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018).
        Anyone using personal data must comply with the data protection legislation.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The data protection principles in the GDPR require that personal data shall be:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject</li>
        <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes</li>
        <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed</li>
        <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay</li>
        <li>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject</li>
        <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures</li>

        Please be aware that under the rights of data subjects at article 15 of the GDPR an individual may make a

        disclosed and the source of the data.
