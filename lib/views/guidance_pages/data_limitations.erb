              to ensure that the energy certificate retrieval process is successfully completed.
              Mandatory data items cannot be applied retrospectively to energy certificates lodged before the date of the change.

              The production of a 'default' DEC value was allowed to enable building occupiers, with poor quality or no energy data, the opportunity to comply with the regulations.

              There are currently just over 8,600 records where the local authority identifier is 'null'.
              This is due to the Register Operator not being able to match the building address in the Markermap Ordinance Survey (GB) lookup tables or OS MasterMap Address Layer 2 data.
              The majority of these addresses have been requested manually by energy assessors for inclusion by the Register Operator in the registers (e.g. new builds, etc).
              These records are being published for completeness. An ongoing process to manage these manually added addresses will take time to develop to deal with these and future anomalies.

              There are several fields within the lodged data where it is possible to enter multiple entries to cater for different types of build within a single property, i.e. extensions.
              This results in multiple entries for the description fields for a floor, roof and wall. For the purposes of this data release, only the information contained within the first of these multiple entries is being provided.
              As there are no restrictions on the value in this first field it means that sometimes the first field in a multiple entry description field may contain a 'null' value.
              A resolution to correct these anomalies will be considered for future data releases.

              Higher than expected values for certain data variables, such as CO2 emissions;
              current and potential heating costs, may be caused by a combination of anomalous data entries and functionality issues with proprietary software.
              Although it's not possible to identify what proportion of extreme values are anomalous, to account for this,
              data users may wish to apply the 'median' when looking at averages in their analysis, as a way of quality assuring the 'mean' to account for any extreme values.
